# Default Skip Checks for Kubernetes - Checks that commonly fail
# This file contains Kubernetes checks that are often too strict or not applicable
# Users can add additional checks via CHECKOV_SKIP_CHECKS in .env file
# These defaults are automatically loaded and merged with user-specified checks

# Add commonly failing or non-critical Kubernetes checks here
# One check ID per line
# Lines starting with # are comments

# Commonly failing checks that may be skipped
# CKV_K8S_8 - Liveness Probe Should be Configured (often not needed for all workloads)
# CKV_K8S_9 - Readiness Probe Should be Configured (often not needed for all workloads)
# CKV_K8S_22 - Use read-only filesystem (not always practical)
# CKV_K8S_28 - Minimize NET_RAW capability (may be needed for some workloads)
# CKV_K8S_31 - Seccomp profile (not always configured)
# CKV_K8S_35 - Secrets as files vs env vars (env vars are common and acceptable)
# CKV_K8S_37 - Minimize capabilities (may be needed for some workloads)
# CKV_K8S_40 - High UID (not always applicable)
# CKV_K8S_43 - Image digest (tags are commonly used)

# Skip commonly failing checks which are often too strict or not applicable to all workloads
# Operational checks (not security-critical)
CKV_K8S_8
CKV_K8S_9

# Security checks that are important but commonly failing (can be re-enabled when infrastructure is hardened)
# These checks are failing in current infrastructure but represent good security practices
