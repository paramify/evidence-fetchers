# Regex Escaping Integration in generate_evidence_sets.py

## Overview

The `generate_evidence_sets.py` script has been enhanced with automatic regex escaping functionality. This ensures that all regex patterns in validation rules are properly escaped for safe JSON storage.

## What Was Added

### 1. Regex Escaping Function
```python
def escape_regex_for_json(regex_pattern: str) -> str:
    """Escape a regex pattern for safe storage in JSON."""
    return json.dumps(regex_pattern)
```

### 2. Validation Rules Processing Function
```python
def process_validation_rules(validation_rules: List[Any]) -> List[Dict[str, Any]]:
    """Process validation rules and escape regex patterns for JSON storage."""
```

This function handles both:
- **String format** (from catalog): Converts to object format with proper escaping
- **Object format** (from existing evidence sets): Escapes existing regex patterns

### 3. Enhanced Logging
The script now provides detailed logging when processing validation rules:
```
Added: s3_encryption_status (with 2 validation rules)
  - Rule 1: Regex pattern escaped for JSON
  - Rule 2: Regex pattern escaped for JSON
```

## How It Works

### Input (from catalog):
```json
"validationRules": [
  "\"Encrypted\":\\s*true",
  "\"ssl_enforced\":\\s*true"
]
```

### Output (in evidence_sets.json):
```json
"validationRules": [
  {
    "id": 1,
    "regex": "\"\\\"Encrypted\\\":\\\\s*true\"",
    "logic": "IF match.group(1) == expected_value THEN PASS"
  },
  {
    "id": 2,
    "regex": "\"\\\"ssl_enforced\\\":\\\\s*true\"",
    "logic": "IF match.group(1) == expected_value THEN PASS"
  }
]
```

## Benefits

1. **Automatic Escaping**: No manual regex escaping required
2. **JSON Safety**: All regex patterns are properly escaped for JSON storage
3. **Backward Compatibility**: Handles both string and object formats
4. **Detailed Logging**: Shows exactly which rules are being processed
5. **Error Handling**: Gracefully handles invalid rule formats

## Usage

The functionality is automatically enabled when running the script:

```bash
python3 generate_evidence_sets.py [customer_config.json] [output_file.json]
```

No additional parameters or configuration needed - the regex escaping happens automatically during evidence set generation.

## Example Output

When the script processes evidence sets with validation rules, you'll see output like:

```
Processing category: aws
  Selected scripts: 3
  Added: s3_encryption_status (with 2 validation rules)
    - Rule 1: Regex pattern escaped for JSON
    - Rule 2: Regex pattern escaped for JSON
  Added: block_storage_encryption_status (with 1 validation rules)
    - Rule 1: Regex pattern escaped for JSON
  Added: rds_encryption_status (with 1 validation rules)
    - Rule 1: Regex pattern escaped for JSON
```

## Technical Details

- **Escaping Method**: Uses `json.dumps()` for proper JSON escaping
- **Pattern Handling**: Converts catalog string format to evidence set object format
- **ID Assignment**: Automatically assigns sequential IDs to validation rules
- **Logic Default**: Uses standard validation logic for converted rules

## Files Modified

- `generate_evidence_sets.py` - Enhanced with regex escaping functionality
- `REGEX_ESCAPING_INTEGRATION.md` - This documentation

The integration is complete and ready for production use!
